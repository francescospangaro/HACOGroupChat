# HACOGroupChat
A highly available, causally ordered group chat for the Distributed Systems course A.Y. 2023/2024.  
  
Implement a `distributed` group chat application.  
Users can create and delete rooms. For each room, the set of participants is specified at creation time and is never modified.  
Users can post new messages for a room they are participating to.  
Within each room, messages should be delivered in causal order.  
The application should be `fully distributed`, meaning that user clients should exchange
messages without relying on any centralized server.  
The application should be `highly available`, meaning that users should be able to use the
chat (read and write messages) even if they are temporarily disconnected from the network.  
The project can be implemented as a real distributed application (for example, in Java) or it
can be simulated using OmNet++.  
  
**Assumptions**  
â€¢ Clients and links are reliable, but clients can join and leave the network at any time  
  
We chose to implement the application with a real distributed application using Java.
